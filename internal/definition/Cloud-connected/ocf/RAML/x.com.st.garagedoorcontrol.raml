      Posting opening or open in the closed or closing state will transit
      the state to opening. The opening state will last for 10 - 20 seconds
      until the door is completely open. Posting closing or closed in the
      open or closed state will transit the state to closing. The closing
      state will last for 10 - 20 seconds until the door is completely closed.
